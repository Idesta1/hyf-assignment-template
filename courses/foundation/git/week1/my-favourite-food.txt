Fish Balls (Simple Home Recipe)

Ingredients:
- 500 g white fish fillets (cod, pollock or haddock), skin removed
- 1 egg, lightly beaten
- 2 spring onions, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil
- 1/2 teaspoon salt (adjust to taste)
- 1/4 teaspoon white or black pepper
- 3 tablespoons cornstarch (plus extra for dusting)
- Vegetable oil, for frying or cooking

Instructions:
1. Chop the fish into small pieces and place into a large bowl or food processor.
2. Add the egg, spring onions, garlic, soy sauce, sesame oil, salt and pepper.
3. Pulse or mix until you get a smooth, sticky paste. If too loose, add 1 tablespoon cornstarch at a time until the mixture holds together.
4. Wet your hands and shape the mixture into small balls (about 1" / 2–3 cm diameter).
5. Option A — Boil: Bring a pot of water to a gentle boil and drop the fish balls in. Cook until they float (3–5 minutes). Remove with a slotted spoon.
   Option B — Pan-fry: Heat 2–3 tablespoons vegetable oil in a skillet and shallow-fry the fish balls, turning occasionally, until golden and cooked through (about 6–8 minutes).
6. Serve hot with dipping sauce, in noodle soup, or as a snack.

Tips:
- For a springier texture, chill the fish paste for 30 minutes before shaping.
- You can substitute a mixture of fish and shrimp for a different flavor.
