Intro to Backend Exercise

In this exercise I have learned how to set up node.js with express and knex to create a simple backend server that can handle HTTP requests and interact with a database. 

I have created routes to get all tasks and users, add new users, get the user count with styled HTML response, and delete users by ID. 

 I was also able to practice handling different HTTP methods such as GET, POST, and DELETE, as well as working with JSON data and SQL queries. 
 
 Overall, this exercise has provided me with a solid foundation in backend development concepts and techniques. I have also learned about postman and (thunder client) which was recommended by mentor(Karo) to test my API endpoints.
