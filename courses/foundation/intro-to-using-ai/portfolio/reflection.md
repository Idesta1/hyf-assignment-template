1.  I have learned that if AI is prompted the right way it can give us the right solution.
    It can also give a more complex solution depending on the AI model.
    It can help me explain my mistakes and suggest further improvements.(debugging)

2.  when it gives me a more complex code then I use my own judgement or prompt to give me a simple specific solution.

3.  If we only use the generated code and use it without understanding then we would not learn anything vs if we use it as a learning ground by interacting then we can enhance our knowledge of coding.

4.  Not being able to learn and understand the material
    if we don't understand the material chances of becoming a developer will be low.
    basically it will limit us from learning
